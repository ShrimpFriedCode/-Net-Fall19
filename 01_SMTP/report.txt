1. Attempting to send to a non IU email address fails, as we do not have the proper authentication to send to an 
outside resource, as we are an unauthenticated user on the mail relay.  

2. You can use any made up mail address to send, as smtp does not attempt to validate the sending address and will deliver it regardless of the supplied address.
